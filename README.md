# Neural-Network
This project implements a data-fitting classifier that can predict the label of an input vector. Specifically, in the context of hand-written digit classification, the label is an integer number between 0 to 9, and the input vector is a vectorized 28 Ã— 28 image with each element as a floating-point number ranging from 0 to 1
